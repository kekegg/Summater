# Adversarial Autoencoder
Replicates Adversarial Autoencoder architecture from [Makhzani, Alireza, et al. "Adversarial autoencoders." arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.05644 (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644). 

The code is adapted from Naresh's implementation [here](https://github.com/Naresh1318/Adversarial_Autoencoder). Thanks Naresh!

The code here aims to add two mnist pictures to their sum picture.
